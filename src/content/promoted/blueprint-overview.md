The Website Blueprint is an opinionated starting point for real websites. It pairs Astro 5's content-first architecture with Cloudflare's edge network to give you fast builds, instant deploys, and a CMS-free authoring workflow based on Markdown and content collections. Every design decision — from the OKLCH gray palette to the hybrid SSR strategy — is deliberate and documented.
