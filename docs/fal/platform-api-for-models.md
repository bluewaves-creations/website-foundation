# Platform APIs for Models

> Programmatic access to model metadata, pricing, usage tracking, and analytics

The **fal Platform APIs** provide programmatic access to platform management features for Model APIs, including:

* **Model metadata** - Search and discover available model endpoints with detailed information
* **Pricing information** - Retrieve real-time pricing and estimate costs
* **Usage tracking** - Access detailed usage line items with unit quantities and prices
* **Analytics** - Query time-bucketed metrics for request counts, success/error rates, and latency

## Available Operations
