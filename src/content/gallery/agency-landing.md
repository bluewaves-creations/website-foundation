Agencies need credibility pages fast — a professional web presence that showcases past work, introduces the team, and converts visitors into leads. The blueprint's content collections and contact form cover every piece.

## What You'd Change

Turn the promoted cards into case study highlights with client logos, project descriptions, and outcome metrics. Create a new "team" collection with fields for name, role, photo, and bio. The testimonials collection already handles client quotes — just populate it with real feedback.

Customize the contact form to include a project budget dropdown and a services checklist. The existing API route sends email via Cloudflare Email Routing, so inquiries land directly in your inbox with all the details structured and ready to triage.

## Why the Blueprint Fits

Agency sites change infrequently but need to look polished and load fast. Prerendered pages with edge caching give you both. When you win a new client and need to update the case studies, it's a Markdown file and a deploy — no CMS login, no database migration.
