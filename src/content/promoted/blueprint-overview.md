Building a website used to mean choosing between creative control and technical speed. The Website Foundation changes that equation. You describe what you want — a photography portfolio, a product launch page, a developer docs site — and Claude Code builds it across every file that needs to change: components, styles, API routes, content schemas, and tests. The architecture underneath (Astro 5, Tailwind CSS v4, Cloudflare Workers) is deliberately chosen so that collaboration produces production-ready results, not prototypes you'll rewrite later.
