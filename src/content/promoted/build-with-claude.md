From the first `astro create` command to the final deploy, every component, API route, and content schema in this foundation was developed through conversation with Claude Code. Not generated and abandoned — shaped iteratively, with each pass producing coherent changes across every file involved. The result is a codebase where the patterns are consistent, the tests pass, and the build succeeds, because both partners were paying attention to the whole picture.
