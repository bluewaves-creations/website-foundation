Every line of code in this foundation was created through conversation with Claude Code. Not "generated by AI" in the way that phrase usually implies — shaped together, iteratively, with a human providing direction and Claude Code providing coherent multi-file implementation. Here's what that partnership actually looks like.

## Start with Intent, Not Boilerplate

Instead of copy-pasting starter templates and wiring them together, you describe what you want:

> "Create an Astro 5 site with Tailwind v4, content collections for blog and gallery, and Cloudflare Workers SSR."

Claude Code scaffolds the project structure, installs dependencies, writes the Astro config with the Cloudflare adapter, and sets up the content schemas — all before you've opened a single file manually. The result is a working skeleton that builds and deploys from minute one.

Here's what a typical opening session looks like:

> **You**: "I want a photography portfolio. Hero section with my name, a gallery grid, an about page, and a contact form that emails me."
>
> **Claude Code**: Creates the homepage layout, gallery collection schema, about page, contact form component, email API route, and wires them together. Runs the build to verify everything compiles.
>
> **You**: "The gallery images should be square with a hover zoom. And add a lightbox."
>
> **Claude Code**: Updates the gallery card component, adds Tailwind classes for aspect-square and scale-on-hover, creates a lightbox script with keyboard navigation. The grid stays responsive, the dark mode still works.

Each exchange produces a coherent set of changes — not a single file in isolation, but every file that needs to change to make the feature complete.

## Iterate in Conversation

Once the skeleton exists, development becomes a conversation. Each feature request produces a complete implementation across all the files it touches:

- "Add a contact form that sends email via Cloudflare Email Routing" creates the form component, the API route, the email utility module, and the validation logic.
- "Add dark mode with a toggle that persists to localStorage" produces the theme toggle component, the inline script to prevent flash, and the CSS custom variant.
- "Make the promoted cards link to blog posts with a 'Read more' button" updates the card component, the content schema, and the homepage query.

The key is that each pass is coherent — the component, the route, the utility, and the tests all follow the same patterns.

## The Plugin System

The Website Foundation includes a Claude Code plugin that gives Claude Code deep knowledge of this specific project. It's not just a generic AI — it understands the architecture, the patterns, and the conventions:

- **10 slash commands** like `/new-post`, `/rebrand`, and `/deploy` that handle common workflows in a single step
- **8 knowledge skills** covering architecture, styling patterns, content schemas, and Cloudflare bindings
- **2 specialized agents** for complex multi-step tasks like full-site audits and component creation
- **Quality hooks** that check your work automatically

When you type `/rebrand` and describe your business, Claude Code knows every file that contains the sample branding — site title, meta descriptions, header logo, footer text, Open Graph images — and updates them all coherently. When you type `/new-post`, it knows the exact frontmatter schema and creates a properly structured Markdown file.

## Test as You Go

Every lib module in the foundation accepts `env` as its first parameter. This isn't an accident — it's a deliberate pattern for testability:

```typescript
// The real module
export async function sendEmail(env: Env, options: EmailOptions) {
  const msg = new EmailMessage(options.from, options.to, rawEmail);
  await env.EMAIL.send(msg);
}

// The test
const env = createMockEnv();
await sendEmail(env, { from, to, subject, body });
expect(env.EMAIL.send).toHaveBeenCalled();
```

Claude Code writes Vitest tests alongside the implementation, using `createMockEnv()` and `createMockContext()` helpers that mirror the real Cloudflare bindings. The result is 42 tests across 7 files that run in under a second.

## Ship with Confidence

The final step is deployment. `bun run deploy` pushes the entire site to Cloudflare's global network. Because every component has been tested against the same schemas and patterns, there are no last-minute surprises.

The build step catches schema violations, the type checker catches binding mismatches, and the tests catch logic errors — three layers of verification before any code reaches production.

## What This Partnership Enables

The Website Foundation exists because this kind of creative partnership makes it possible to build something real in a weekend. Not a toy, not a prototype — a production site with proper architecture, edge deployment, email delivery, access control, and a test suite.

You bring the vision: what your site should look like, who it's for, what it needs to do. Claude Code brings the implementation: coherent changes across dozens of files, following documented patterns, with tests that pass and builds that succeed. Neither partner could produce the result alone — and that's exactly the point.
