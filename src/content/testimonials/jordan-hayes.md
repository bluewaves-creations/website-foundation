I told Claude Code to add a waitlist endpoint with KV storage, protect admin pages with Cloudflare Access, and set up email notifications for new signups. Each feature came with tests, proper error handling, and the right Wrangler bindings. It felt like pair-programming with someone who already knew the whole codebase.
